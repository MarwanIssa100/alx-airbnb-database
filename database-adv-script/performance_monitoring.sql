-- ============================================================================
-- IDENTIFIED BOTTLENECKS AND OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS
-- ============================================================================

-- Bottleneck 1: Missing composite index for user booking history
-- Problem: Query 1 performs full table scan on booking table
-- Solution: Create composite index on (user_id, start_date)
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_date ON booking(user_id, start_date DESC);

-- Bottleneck 2: Missing index for date range queries
-- Problem: Query 3 performs full table scan for date filtering
-- Solution: Create index on start_date
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON booking(start_date);

-- Bottleneck 3: Missing composite index for property availability
-- Problem: Query 2 has complex date range conditions
-- Solution: Create composite index for availability checks
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_status_dates ON booking(property_id, status, start_date, end_date);

-- Bottleneck 4: Missing index for revenue analysis
-- Problem: Query 3 needs efficient grouping and aggregation
-- Solution: Create composite index for date-based aggregations
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_date_status_price ON booking(start_date, status, total_price);

-- Bottleneck 5: Missing index for user activity analysis
-- Problem: Query 5 needs efficient user-based aggregations

-- SCHEMA OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS
-- ============================================================================

-- Suggestion 1: Add covering indexes for frequently accessed columns
-- This reduces the need to access the main table for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_covering ON booking(booking_id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status);

-- Suggestion 2: Partition the booking table by date (if not already done)
-- This improves performance for date-range queries
-- (See partitioning.sql for implementation)

-- Suggestion 3: Add computed columns for frequently calculated values
-- Example: Add booking_duration column to avoid calculating it repeatedly
ALTER TABLE booking ADD COLUMN booking_duration INT AS (DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date)) STORED;
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_duration ON booking(booking_duration);
